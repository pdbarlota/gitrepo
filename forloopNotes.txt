if condition 
//condition return should be always boolean
//if condition data type is other thaan boolean we will compilation error  

if(condition){
// if body will run only condition is true 
}else {
	//else body will run only if condition is false 
}

//if we have multiple if condition and it is interlink 

if(condition){
  // this condition will be check first 
  //if it is true ,rest of the condition will be skipped 
} else if (condition){
	
	//if above condition is false then it will check and
	// this body will execute only when else if condition is true 

} else if (condition){

} else {

	//else will be executed if all above condition is false
	//maximum one else condition will be having 
}

Switch 

Switch Syntax 
// switch condition can not be boolean , if it is boolean then compilation error 
//switch internally do the equality check 
// condition data type and case data type should be same 
// u need to you break statement with in each case else it will execute all below cases 
// with the condition we can pass expression var%2
//duplicate cases are not allowed 
switch(condition){ 

case 0 :

case 2 :

case 3:

default :

}

=================================================================================
for loop 
// whenever we have to perform or execute some set of statement repetative then we use loops
// when we know no of iteration to be execute 
// for loop is divided in three section 
	initialization ---> from where he has to start the execution 
	condition --> Till what condition he has to execute same statement 
	increment/decrement --->
// whether all three section is not mandatory --it will execute till you get outof memory 
		for (;;){
		}
// postfix /prefix will not have any impact 
// declaration can happen outside but initialization is mandatory in for loop 
//
for loop syntax

for (initialization;condition;increment/decrement){

}

///= for loop execution follow
Iteration 1-
Step1 - initialization (int i=1)
step2 -if will check for condition, 
step3 -if condition is true then for loop will execute
step4- increment/decrement
Iteration 2-
step2 -if will check for condition, 
step3 -if condition is true then for loop will execute
step4- increment/decrement
